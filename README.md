# Species-Classification this is my project dawg
## Getting Started with Streamlit 

## Overview
This repository contains a simple machine learning project that uses Streamlit to create a web-based application for species classification. The app uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on the Iris dataset to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.

## Requirements
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Scikit-learn
4. Streamlit

## App Description 
The app consists of a sidebar with four sliders to input the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of an iris flower. Once the input values are set, the user can click the "Predict the species" button to get the predicted species.

## Installation 
1. Clone the repository
```cmd
git clone https://https://github.com/kiran-91/Customer-Churn-using-Neural-Nets.git
cd Customer-Churn-using-Neural-Nets
```
2. Setup a virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
```cmd
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```
3. Install required dependencies
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the Streamlit app
```cmd
streamlit run app.py
```

## Results
If you're on Team Lazy like me and would rather skip all the tasks, no worriesâ€”just kick back and check out the Streamlit app right here!
