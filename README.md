# Species-Classification

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that uses Streamlit to create a web-based application for species classification. The app uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on the Iris dataset to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.

## Requirements
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Scikit-learn
4. Streamlit

## App Description 
The app consists of a sidebar with four sliders to input the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of an iris flower. Once the input values are set, the user can click the "Predict the species" button to get the predicted species.
